*No-one* expects the comfy chair!

WIP on custom nodes for ComfyUI.

## PolySlider

A visual slider control for combining three or more variables, particularly useful when you want to limit the total sum. Useful for e.g. controlling maximum weight using multiple Loras without them "fighting".

# Ideas

## Ghost note

A text note node that won't appear in the saved json inside a saved png (is this possible?). (Can configure it to not ghost if you want.)

## Commentable prompt box

Lines starting `//` or `#` are ignored.
